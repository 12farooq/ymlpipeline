Adding Group in Ubuntu

In Unix-like systems, including Ubuntu, a file or directory can have only one owner and one group owner. However, you can add multiple users to a group, and then assign that group as the group owner of the directory. This allows multiple users to have shared access to the directory. 

 

Here are the steps to add multiple users to a group and assign that group as the group owner of a directory: 

 

1. Create a Group (if not already created): 

 

   You can create a new group using the `sudo groupadd` command. Replace `<groupname>` with the desired group name. 

 

   ```bash 

   sudo groupadd <groupname> 

   ``` 

 

2. Add Users to the Group: 

 

   Use the `sudo usermod -aG` command to add users to the group. Replace `<username>` with the usernames of the users you want to add, and `<groupname>` with the name of the group you created in step 1. 

 

   ```bash 

   sudo usermod -aG <groupname> <username1> 

   sudo usermod -aG <groupname> <username2> 

   # Add more users as needed 

   ``` 

 

3. Change the Group Owner of the Directory: 

 

   You can use the `chown` command to change the group owner of the directory to the group you created. Replace `<directory>` with the directory path. 

 

   ```bash 

   sudo chown -R :<groupname> <directory> 

   ``` 

 

   For example, if you have a directory named `/var/www/api.ecommerce.techpath.pro/public_html` and you want to assign it to the group named `mygroup`, you would run: 

 

   ```bash 

   sudo chown -R :mygroup /var/www/api.ecommerce.techpath.pro/public_html 

   ``` 

 

Now, any user who is a member of the `mygroup` group will have group-level access to the directory, allowing them to read, write, and execute files within it, depending on the directory's permissions.
