Create a resource group: A resource group is a logical container for Azure resources, such as virtual machines, storage accounts, and networking resources. You can create a resource group from the Azure portal, and assign it a name and a region. 

Create a virtual machine: A virtual machine is a virtualized computer that runs in the cloud. You can create a virtual machine from the Azure portal, and choose the operating system, disk size, and other configuration options. 

Deploy an application: Once you have created a virtual machine, you can deploy your application to it. This can be done through various methods, such as FTP, Git, or through the Azure portal. 

Monitor and manage your resources: Azure provides a variety of tools for monitoring and managing your resources, such as the Azure portal, Azure CLI, and Azure PowerShell. You can use these tools to view performance metrics, set up alerts, and manage your resources.
