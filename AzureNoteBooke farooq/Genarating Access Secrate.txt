Genrating Access-Secret
To obtain the `tenant_id`, `client_id`, and `client_secret` for accessing Azure Key Vault, you need to follow these steps: 

 

1. Sign in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com). 

 

2. In the Azure portal, navigate to the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant associated with your subscription. 

 

3. Go to the "App registrations" or "Azure AD App Registrations" section. 

 

4. Click on "New registration" or "Register an application" to create a new Azure AD application. 

 

5. Provide a name for your application, select the appropriate account type (single-tenant or multi-tenant), and specify the redirect URI if needed. 

 

6. After registering the application, you'll be redirected to the application's overview page. Note down the "Application (client) ID" value, which represents the `client_id` in your code. 

 

7. Go to the "Certificates & secrets" or "Client secrets" section. 

 

8. Click on "New client secret" or "New client secret" to create a new client secret for your application. Provide a description and select the expiration duration. 

 

9. Once the client secret is generated, note down the value. This is your `client_secret` in the code. 

 

10. In the Azure portal, go to the "Azure Active Directory" section. 

 

11. Click on "Properties" to access the properties of your Azure AD tenant. 

 

12. Note down the "Directory (tenant) ID" value. This is your `tenant_id` in the code. 

 

By following these steps, you can obtain the `tenant_id`, `client_id`, and `client_secret` required for authenticating and accessing Azure Key Vault using a service principal (Azure AD application). Make sure to keep the `client_secret` secure and not expose it in any publicly accessible code or configuration files.
