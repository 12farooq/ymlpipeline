Docker Host

Install Docker: If Docker is not already installed on your Ubuntu server, you can follow the official Docker documentation to install it. 

Create a Docker container: Build and configure your Docker container for your project. Make sure you have a Dockerfile or a Docker Compose file that defines your project's services and dependencies. 

Start the Docker container: Run the Docker container to ensure it works as expected. You can use the docker run command or docker-compose up depending on your project's setup. 

Configure Apache: Now, you need to configure Apache to act as a reverse proxy to your Docker container. 

Enable the required Apache modules: Run the following commands to enable the necessary Apache modules: 

 

sudo a2enmod proxy 

sudo a2enmod proxy_http 

sudo systemctl restart apache2 

 

 

Create a new Apache virtual host configuration file: Run the following command to create a new virtual host configuration file: 

 

sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/docker-project.conf 

 

Inside the configuration file, add the following content: 

 

<VirtualHost *:80> 

    ServerName your-domain.com 

    ServerAlias www.your-domain.com 

 

    ProxyPass / http://localhost:CONTAINER_PORT/ 

    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:CONTAINER_PORT/ 

</VirtualHost> 

 

Replace your-domain.com with your actual domain name and CONTAINER_PORT with the port number your Docker container is listening on. 

Enable the virtual host: Enable the virtual host by creating a symbolic link in the sites-enabled directory: 

 

 

sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/docker-project.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/ 
 
sudo systemctl restart apache2 

 

Configure DNS (if necessary): If you are hosting your project on a domain name, make sure to configure the DNS settings for your domain to point to your server's IP address. 

After completing these steps, your Docker project should be accessible through the virtual host configured with Apache. You can access it by entering your domain name (or server's IP address) in a web browser. Apache will forward the requests to your Docker container, and you should see your application running.
