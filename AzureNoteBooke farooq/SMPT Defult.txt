SMPT Default
Install the necessary packages: 
Open a terminal and run the following command to install the required packages: 
 
shellCopy code 
sudo apt-get install sendmail  
This will install the Sendmail mail transfer agent, which is commonly used as the default mailer for PHP on Ubuntu. 

Configure Sendmail: 
Once the installation is complete, you'll need to configure Sendmail. Open the Sendmail configuration file using a text editor: 
 
shellCopy code 
sudo nano /etc/mail/sendmail.mc  

Locate the line that starts with dnl define(SMART_HOST', 'smtp.your.provider')and remove thednlat the beginning to uncomment the line. This line sets the SMTP server that Sendmail will use to send emails. Replacesmtp.your.provider` with the address of your SMTP server. If you don't have an SMTP server, you can use your ISP's SMTP server or a third-party service like Gmail. 

Save the changes and exit the text editor. 

Regenerate the Sendmail configuration: 
After modifying the sendmail.mc file, you need to regenerate the Sendmail configuration file by running the following command in the terminal: 
 
shellCopy code 
sudo sendmailconfig  
This will update the configuration files based on the changes you made. 

Restart Sendmail: 
Finally, restart the Sendmail service to apply the new configuration: 
 
shellCopy code 
sudo service sendmail restart  
Sendmail should now be enabled as the default mailer for PHP on your Ubuntu system. 

Please note that the above steps assume you have a basic understanding of using the command line in Ubuntu. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask for help.
