Symlink-Folder



To point the `/var/www/` folder to a location under `/media/server/data-5121/`, you can use symbolic links (symlinks). Here are the steps to achieve this: 

 

1. **Backup Your Data (Optional):** Before making significant changes like this, it's always a good idea to back up your data to prevent accidental data loss. 

 

2. **Move Your Data (If Necessary):** If there's any data in `/var/www/` that you want to keep, move it to the new location `/media/server/data-5121/`. 

 

3. **Create a Symlink:** 

 

   Open a terminal and use the `ln` command to create a symbolic link. Replace `/media/server/data-5121/` with the full path to your desired target folder. 

 

   ```bash 

   sudo ln -s /media/server/data-5121/ /var/www 

   ``` 

 

   This command creates a symbolic link named `/var/www` that points to `/media/server/data-5121/`. 

 

4. **Verify the Symlink:** 

 

   You can verify that the symlink has been created correctly by listing the contents of `/var/www/`: 

 

   ```bash 

   ls -l /var/www 

   ``` 

 

   You should see something like: 

 

   ``` 

   lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 27 Sep 23 10:00 /var/www -> /media/server/data-5121/ 

   ``` 

 

   The arrow (`->`) indicates the symlink. 

 

5. **Test Your Web Server:** 

 

   If you are using a web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx), make sure to update the server configuration to point to the new path (`/var/www/`) if necessary. 

 

6. **Restart Services (If Needed):** Depending on your setup, you may need to restart your web server or other services that use the webroot folder to apply the changes. 

 

Now, your `/var/www/` folder should effectively point to `/media/server/data-5121/`. Any content placed in `/var/www/` will be stored in the `/media/server/data-5121/` location.
